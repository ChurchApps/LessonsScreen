# Lessons Screen

> **Lessons Screen** is the companion app for [Lessons.church](https://github.com/ChurchApps/LessonsApp/). It runs on any Android TV device and will pre-fetch each weeks lesson in the classroom so they're ready to be displayed on Sunday without needing an Internet connection.  The lessons can be scheduled in advance for classrooms and customized.
